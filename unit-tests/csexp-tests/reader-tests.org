These are tests of the sexp reader.  This file will be parsed by the unit
tester, and feed every line beginning with a '>' character to the sexp_reader
function.  the output is compared against the line that directly follows it.

In future iterations, multiple lines may be used for the output.

the atom <NULL> is reserved.  It is used to indicate that ~sexp_reader~ should
fail to parse the input text.  It indicates that the reader should return NULL.
